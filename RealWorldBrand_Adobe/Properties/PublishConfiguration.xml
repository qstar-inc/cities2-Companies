**Hey guys, it's star q back with another revolutionary mod for cities skylines two.**

# Real World Brands: Adobe

This mod adds "Abobe Inc." as a Software Company in the game. Can spawn on any zone which can spawn a 'Software Company' (only Office in Vanilla).

Additionally includes 43 decals for 56 brand graphics.

# DISCLAIMER
* Safe to remove. This mod will not break your save if removed. However the assets will no longer work.
* This mod may require ***Asset Packs Manager*** which is highly experimental. This mod shouldn't break the save game. But subscribing to assets that require this without the dependency will pop up errors. Worst case you'll get error popups on game load and/or grey boxes in save. But either way, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE for any damage. Contact me on Discord and I'll try to help you recover anyway.
* Including a brand/company in these mods does not imply endorsement nor disapproval of the real-world counterpart's actions or behaviour.
* Includes copyrighted/trademarked content. All trademarks are property of their respective owners in the US and other countries. Nominative Fair Use applies.

# CREDIT
* The custom decals in this package were provided by @m00n22 (Discord) and built using the [Brand Decal Template](https://github.com/qstar-inc/Tidbits/tree/main/cities2/BrandDecalTemplate).
