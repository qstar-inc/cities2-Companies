# Real World Brands: Adobe

## WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL ASSET MOD

These are asset mods that takes best of both worlds and merge them together...

Now, you can have various real world brands in your city.

Paradox mod doesn't require APM or EAI.
Other mod doesn't require EAI.

But special shoutouts to:

- [Konsi / Mimonsi](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/authors/Mimonsi) for creating [Asset Packs Manager](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/78903/Windows)
- [Alpha Gaming / Triton Supreme](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/authors/Triton%20Supreme) for creating [Extra Asset Importer](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/80529/Windows)

Those mods are the reason this is even possible.
