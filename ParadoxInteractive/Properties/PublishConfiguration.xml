# WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL ASSET MOD
This is an asset mod that takes best of both worlds and merge them together...

Now you can have Paradox Interactive as a Software Office or a Recreational Commercial in your city.

This mod doesn't require APM or EAI.

But special shoutouts to:
* [Konsi / Mimonsi](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/authors/Mimonsi) for creating [Asset Packs Manager](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/78903/Windows)
* [Alpha Gaming / Triton Supreme](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/authors/Triton%20Supreme) for creating [Extra Asset Importer](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/80529/Windows)

Those mods are the reason this is even possible.

If this is fruitful, I'll be adding more assets to this and other companies as well.

# What you need to do?
Play the game and see if you can get any Paradox Interactive business/assets get spawned. See the screenshots to see all currently available billboards.
Take a screenshot and post it in CS:Modding Discord Server or CS Official Server, don't forget to ping me!
